## The Curious Case of Neural Text DeGeneration  
- nucleus_greedy.ipynb consists of the inference code and metrics calculation code
   
- decodings_implementation.ipynb contains my own implementation of the major decoding strategies used in the paper
  
- data folder has all the prompts used for inference
   
- generations folder has all the generated sequences under various decoding strategies
