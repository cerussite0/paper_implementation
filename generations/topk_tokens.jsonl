A time when even doom 2 hadn't been released (I didn't even know about that, but had to be included), I knew I was going to be making one hell of a Doom soundtrack. Doom was my favorite video game of all time. I couldn't get enough of it, so I made a lot of it and recorded enough audio to build a collection of tunes and remix albums to go along with it - the ones I've released on LP. I had a couple of fun projects I was trying to make, like a new version of the Doom theme with my friends. When it came time for us to start making music for Doom 2, the project was in pretty rough shape - the music had some rough edges on it, some of it had a kind of 'floppy' feel to it, and the whole soundtrack we were making was too big for the 8-track I had on a laptop at the time.

{"iteration": 102, "generation": "Analysis: Is it time to get worried about the banks?  Updated  Australia's big bank oligopoly is not enjoying the best of times. The latest Australian Associated Press survey found that only 6 per cent of respondents thought the industry is doing very well. Just under a quarter did not share it at all or say they didn't really care about the industry. This is a dismal picture, given that over the last quarter the banking industry has lost 1.3 million jobs. So a few per cent can hardly be considered a huge gain. The Aussie Financial Review has been following the banks closely since 2001. In the period under review we have examined some of the major financial institutions in the country and compared them to their industry benchmarks.

His death, of course, was the culmination of all this work. This is why he wanted to write so deeply about it. Even if he was a few days late, his story remains the reason why I wrote it at all.

While Ford admits having gone cold turkey for several days before the Star contacted him, the paper noted that he has been living at the home of his brother, Councillor Doug Ford, whom he has frequently criticized for his spending. \"If you're going to go cold turkey,", "tokens": [5703, 1115, 1528, 706, 1719, 465, 43811, 5635, 18939, 10770, 11, 257, 14718, 3851, 8092, 5220, 284, 465, 4466, 4039, 326, 339, 1244, 991, 765, 284, 423, 257, 366, 17089, 3381, 1, 355, 9591, 286, 6586, 13, 554, 326, 2720, 11, 543, 18530, 262, 976, 1110, 355, 281, 3645, 287, 262, 6586, 2907, 656, 262, 9591, 338, 4260, 26680, 5059, 11, 8092, 318, 2982, 5149, 1966, 10636, 4039, 286, 3085, 1757, 1355, 10438, 546, 465, 6227, 284, 1057, 329, 9591, 757, 355, 890, 355, 339, 366, 82, 3080, 257, 1310, 1643, 286, 1637, 526, 4784, 284, 262, 2907, 11, 262, 9591, 318, 635, 3375, 546, 3867, 43321, 11, 3025, 17058, 339, 3382, 284, 2005, 523, 326, 339, 460, 5368, 284, 1414, 329, 2614, 3484, 326, 339, 1139, 389, 3519, 284, 465, 1964, 22455, 13, 5856, 262, 2720, 11, 262, 2907, 2098, 326, 8092, 468, 587, 2877, 5475, 422, 465, 1641, 1141, 257, 640, 618, 339, 468, 2077, 617, 10059, 4831, 284, 21509, 465, 3176, 32687, 13, 2893, 8092, 15534, 1719, 3750, 4692, 26876, 329, 1811, 1528, 878, 262, 2907, 11237, 683, 11, 262, 3348, 4367, 326, 339, 468, 587, 2877, 379, 262, 1363, 286, 465, 3956, 11, 3545, 20346, 273, 15115, 8092, 11, 4150, 339, 468, 6777, 12318, 329, 465, 4581, 13, 366, 1532, 345, 821, 1016, 284, 467, 4692, 26876, 11]}

These criminals, like the Riddler, have no regard for Wayne or his legacy, but they find the new Batman in their midst.\n\nThis group, known simply as the Red Hood, has shown to be extremely skilled at fighting crime and fighting crime's villains.

The disease is caused by the L1 retrotransposon in most forms. It is one of the leading causes of cat leukemia and an inherited disease that can progress rapidly even without treatment. FeLV is mainly seen in cats with either an abnormal Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) gene (mutation) or an abnormal Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) gene (synonymous mutation). There are two common forms of FeLV: the IgM and the IgG. These are the two virus proteins that are present on the cell surface of FeLV patients. The normal M1 gene for FIV is missing from each cat, but in the IgG and IgGV form of the virus the M1 gene is present; however, the IgG variant is known to be more infectious. If the M1 gene is not present, the FIV is found in the IgM and not the IgG.

In short  A nice feature of usual OO languages is the implicit code generation that is achieved by a constructor. The constructor, like the method, takes an argument that is passed on the stack in this case. The argument passed to the constructor is a value which represents the return value of the constructor. If we call getName() then the class will take this argument as the result. But a nice feature of OO languages is that we may give our class a parameter value which we wish to have on the stack. This may be the name of a component or even an input file. Since all the code in the OO language is in the form of a constructor parameter, we can pass in any value and all the information we're interested in will be returned on the stack. This is also a feature that allows us to implement our class as a simple function.

It's not so much that the government has changed the law, it's that the government had a huge incentive to ignore what the Supreme Court said and changed the law anyway. To paraphrase one of my old articles, the reason why an executive orders cannot be reviewed is that the executive is in a position of power. But, when the executive has so much power that it has the potential for destroying entire countries and citizens' lives, one would expect that they would want to exercise that power cautiously. By changing the law to make it difficult to challenge the government's executive actions in this case, the government has given up that risk, and made it very easy for the government to abuse that power once again.

(NOAA via National Science Foundation)  What happens if marine life in the oceans can't adapt because of global warming? It's estimated that as much as 25 percent of the world's marine species may disappear by 2050 for lack of oxygen, the leading single cause of mortality in marine mammals such as whales and tuna. That's because a growing amount of plankton (small shells that break down into hydrogen) in the oceans is a major source of oxygen for marine life, the primary \"fuel\" for photosynthesis needed to produce food and oxygen for all life on Earth. The ocean is also home to more than 300 other species, such as blue whales and sea turtles.

According to Harberger, \"the corporate tax represents one of the biggest distortions of the economy.\" (1997)[3] And he calls the amount of offshore income generated in the US on the basis of information that appears in the books of the US tax authorities \"the most important source of foreign exchange income, about 40% of all offshore income.\" (2005)[4] O'Hara estimates that the gross tax incidence of corporate income for the period 1997\u20132006 was over 90% for the US and Ireland, and over 80% for the UK. According to Loughran, \"it is now accepted almost universally and even in some quarters that the real rate at which US corporations avoid paying corporate income tax is around 100 percent and that the real rate at which European corporations do so is over 70 percent. . . .", "tokens": [3886, 16348, 327, 13, 7037, 626, 293, 220, 770, 3348, 8088, 262, 1459, 2370, 319, 262, 18349, 286, 262, 6355, 1687, 422, 2113, 21041, 290, 440, 6, 39, 3301, 284, 406, 619, 2596, 290, 311, 10381, 319, 262, 4308, 286, 262, 13196, 326, 262, 1271, 286, 6355, 1687, 47450, 318, 257, 2163, 286, 262, 2546, 286, 262, 3773, 13, 4784, 284, 2113, 21041, 11, 366, 1169, 6355, 1687, 6870, 530, 286, 262, 4094, 47876, 286, 262, 3773, 526, 357, 21498, 38381, 18, 60, 843, 339, 3848, 262, 2033, 286, 18479, 3739, 7560, 287, 262, 1294, 319, 262, 4308, 286, 1321, 326, 3568, 287, 262, 3835, 286, 262, 1294, 1687, 4773, 366, 1169, 749, 1593, 2723, 286, 3215, 5163, 3739, 11, 546, 2319, 4, 286, 477, 18479, 3739, 526, 357, 14315, 38381, 19, 60, 440, 6, 39, 3301, 7746, 326, 262, 10319, 1687, 18349, 286, 6355, 3739, 329, 262, 2278, 8309, 1906, 13330, 373, 625, 4101, 4, 329, 262, 1294, 290, 7517, 11, 290, 625, 4019, 4, 329, 262, 3482, 13, 4784, 284, 406, 619, 2596, 11, 366, 270, 318, 783, 6292, 2048, 26208, 290, 772, 287, 617, 13620, 326, 262, 1103, 2494, 379, 543, 1294, 10225, 3368, 5989, 6355, 3739, 1687, 318, 1088, 1802, 1411, 290, 326, 262, 1103, 2494, 379, 543, 3427, 10225, 466, 523, 318, 625, 4317, 1411, 13, 764, 764, 764]}

{"iteration": 299, "generation": "Census History: Counting Hispanics  Despite the long history of Hispanic residents in the United States, there was no systematic effort to count Hispanics, according to the census. In 1960, the census asked respondents whether they were of Hispanic origin, but did not list Hispanics by name. As a result, the total number of people who responded did not provide information on the actual number of Hispanics living in the United States. In 1963, Congress passed legislation to require that Hispanics be counted by the census. In 1970, the administration of President Richard Nixon issued an end-use census to include persons who identified as both Hispanics and non-Hispanic and to make sure any changes to the existing count were implemented. In this report, the number of estimates from this survey are presented. It is important to note that the end-use census provides fewer estimates of Hispanics, because it includes only persons who identified as Hispanic. The Census Bureau conducted a similar survey in 1989 covering a small sample of the Hispanic population. In this 1997 report, we present estimates of the number of Hispanics in Washington State who were 16 years of age or older in 1997.", "tokens": [34, 7314, 7443, 25, 2764, 278, 30714, 220, 7945, 262, 890, 2106, 286, 16949, 5085, 287, 262, 1578, 1829, 11, 612, 373, 645, 17895, 3626, 284, 954, 30714, 11, 1864, 284, 262, 21649, 13, 554, 9507, 11, 262, 21649, 1965, 14502, 1771, 484, 547, 286, 16949, 8159, 11, 475, 750, 407, 1351, 30714, 416, 1438, 13, 1081, 257, 1255, 11, 262, 2472, 1271, 286, 661, 508, 7082, 750, 407, 2148, 1321, 319, 262, 4036, 1271, 286, 30714, 2877, 287, 262, 1578, 1829, 13, 554, 19342, 11, 3162, 3804, 5520, 284, 2421, 326, 30714, 307, 14789, 416, 262, 21649, 13, 554, 8069, 11, 262, 3662, 286, 1992, 6219, 16642, 4884, 281, 886, 12, 1904, 21649, 284, 2291, 6506, 508, 5174, 355, 1111, 30714, 290, 1729, 12, 43830, 290, 284, 787, 1654, 597, 2458, 284, 262, 4683, 954, 547, 9177, 13, 554, 428, 989, 11, 262, 1271, 286, 7746, 422, 428, 5526, 389, 5545, 13, 632, 318, 1593, 284, 3465, 326, 262, 886, 12, 1904, 21649, 3769, 7380, 7746, 286, 30714, 11, 780, 340, 3407, 691, 6506, 508, 5174, 355, 16949, 13, 383, 20962, 9840, 5952, 257, 2092, 5526, 287, 11104, 9505, 257, 1402, 6291, 286, 262, 16949, 3265, 13, 554, 428, 8309, 989, 11, 356, 1944, 7746, 286, 262, 1271, 286, 30714, 287, 2669, 1812, 508, 547, 1467, 812, 286, 2479, 393, 4697, 287, 8309, 13]}

Japan is in deep trouble because, for the past four decades, it has been ruled by a group of self-serving politicians that have turned the economy into a gigantic slush fund.\n\nTheir leaders failed to keep Japan running smoothly. They let public debt balloon. They allowed the government to borrow money out of thin air. This led to the government spending a trillion dollars a year to buy more Japanese government bonds. It turned Japan into a debt-ridden, bankrupt nation, whose politicians now seek to increase debt even for the sake of getting the country back to where it was four decades ago.\n\nIn Japan today, many people have jobs with monthly income that doesn't exceed 4,000 yen ($30) until they're 30 or 40.

So my question to you is, are we now in a situation where the President of the United States is a kind of serial philanderer?

This was a big deal, because many economists thought the deficit would go up again in the future.\n\nA big chunk of the difference was that the economy began recovering at just the right time: a rebound in the employment rate in 2012 after years of stagnation.\n\nBut that recovery, along with the tax cuts, helped shrink the deficit to 1 percentage point less than in 2001 and 2003. And it's possible that if the economy had been stronger during that time, the deficit would have been even less than it is now.\n\nSo, if the economy is strong now, why is the deficit falling?\n\nThere are two possible explanations for that.

{"iteration": 396, "generation": "Space Without Eyes  \"To localize an object means simply to represent the movements that would be necessary to reach it.\" These words of the great French mathematician and physicist \u00c9mile Durkheim, originally published in 1913, appear in a passage of that author's The Origins and Development of the Study of Civilization by John Locke, to which I drew attention recently. (For a review of the Locke and Durkheim debates regarding the social aspects of their theories, see Peter Van Alstyne, \"On the Social Nature and Sources of Durkheim's Theory of Culture,\" Comparative Literature, May-June 1994.) The idea of an 'architecture to be created from scratch' was not the only challenge which Durkheim posed, though, so the question of the meaning of the term 'society' did not seem quite the same as it does now. One might say that a new social order would not just be one without the old, but a new order of values, one with a higher form of organisation, one where each person's value would be different.

Several factors, including CD, can lead to a substantial prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease and, as a result, inflammation is considered a marker of disease burden. CD is associated with increased levels of the cytokines interleukin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. Inflammation is believed to be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including inflammatory cells, food allergy, antibiotics, and medications (1).\n\nRecently, numerous investigators, particularly those studying immune activation in CD, have argued that gut microbiota may play a role in the initiation and progression of the disorder (2\u20136). The prevalence of CD among individuals with autoimmune disease has been increasing in the last decade, which has led to increased recognition that alterations in microbiota may be at least partially responsible for the pathophysiology of the disease, perhaps more so than the presence of immune dysfunction (7).

{"iteration": 467, "generation": "The CDC states that the condition is not caused by an infection or anything in the environment.  The CDC study also included a lab analysis of skin fibers in Morgellons patients. The fibers in the study suggested that Morgellons causes allergic reactions in an unusual way.  In these people's lungs and skin, the pollen-like proteins from the Morgellon pollen could cause a condition called acute bronchitis.  This is a very rare type of asthma. Allergic reactions often occur within the first few days of exposure, and in this case, the reaction occurred within three days after exposure.  In a 2009 study, researchers found that the skin of Morgellon patients had fibers more commonly found on rats compared to humans.  In their studies, researchers found that the skin fibers in the study were more likely to come from the lungs of the Morgellons patients.\n\nSome Morgellons patients say they smell the insects on their shoes or from their pets. While not sure of the role these odors play, scientists in this area have found that Morgellons may cause more complex allergic conditions such as hay fever.\n\n", "tokens": [464, 20434, 2585, 326, 262, 4006, 318, 407, 4073, 416, 281, 10280, 393, 1997, 287, 262, 2858, 13, 220, 383, 20434, 2050, 635, 3017, 257, 2248, 3781, 286, 4168, 26742, 287, 3461, 469, 297, 684, 3871, 13, 383, 26742, 287, 262, 2050, 5220, 326, 3461, 469, 297, 684, 5640, 31856, 12737, 287, 281, 8468, 835, 13, 220, 554, 777, 661, 338, 21726, 290, 4168, 11, 262, 40362, 12, 2339, 15568, 422, 262, 3461, 469, 297, 261, 40362, 714, 2728, 257, 4006, 1444, 14352, 18443, 354, 11815, 13, 220, 770, 318, 257, 845, 4071, 2099, 286, 28438, 13, 1439, 19793, 12737, 1690, 3051, 1626, 262, 717, 1178, 1528, 286, 7111, 11, 290, 287, 428, 1339, 11, 262, 6317, 5091, 1626, 1115, 1528, 706, 7111, 13, 220, 554, 257, 3717, 2050, 11, 4837, 1043, 326, 262, 4168, 286, 3461, 469, 297, 261, 3871, 550, 26742, 517, 8811, 1043, 319, 13623, 3688, 284, 5384, 13, 220, 554, 511, 3640, 11, 4837, 1043, 326, 262, 4168, 26742, 287, 262, 2050, 547, 517, 1884, 284, 1282, 422, 262, 21726, 286, 262, 3461, 469, 297, 684, 3871, 13, 198, 198, 4366, 3461, 469, 297, 684, 3871, 910, 484, 8508, 262, 19435, 319, 511, 10012, 393, 422, 511, 17252, 13, 2893, 407, 1654, 286, 262, 2597, 777, 16298, 669, 711, 11, 5519, 287, 428, 1989, 423, 1043, 326, 3461, 469, 297, 684, 743, 2728, 517, 3716, 31856, 3403, 884, 355, 27678, 17372, 13, 628]}

The Enterprise would be under constant threat from the Borg, and Sasha was one of many who had to make sacrifices for the greater good.

The game had been played too long for the players to get loose, he said, but he went ahead and handed out the starters because he'd been told the coaches needed them.\n\n\"When you're under the control of a coach, there's never a decision where you've got to play with guys,\" said Michigan linebacker Darien Harris, who was unavailable for comment. \"It just so happens to go with the flow of the game and just happen as we were playing so we didn't have to play a whole lot of guys.\"\n\nBy the end, there was a team that did not", "tokens": [22846, 5923, 33, 1581, 1377, 1550, 3909, 1755, 11, 7055, 1816, 832, 262, 749, 300, 2840, 1384, 1377, 290, 15242, 262, 334, 70, 11318, 1377, 2994, 286, 15260, 367, 2088, 338, 17081, 13, 220, 383, 26328, 1127, 357, 18, 12, 18, 11, 657, 12, 15, 4403, 9368, 8, 2622, 281, 17820, 2994, 284, 6835, 1812, 284, 4405, 262, 23627, 43174, 357, 20, 12, 17, 11, 352, 12, 15, 8, 329, 262, 717, 640, 287, 1524, 2106, 13, 198, 198, 39, 2088, 11, 739, 3833, 290, 6476, 281, 6125, 351, 262, 2785, 284, 5938, 465, 1074, 379, 790, 1210, 11, 3066, 284, 1650, 465, 19896, 1566, 262, 604, 25, 1120, 8801, 7425, 15896, 13, 383, 983, 550, 587, 2826, 1165, 890, 329, 262, 1938, 284, 651, 9155, 11, 339, 531, 11, 475, 339, 1816, 4058, 290, 10158, 503, 262, 19896, 780, 339, 1549, 587, 1297, 262, 11070, 2622, 606, 13, 198, 198, 1, 2215, 345, 821, 739, 262, 1630, 286, 257, 3985, 11, 612, 338, 1239, 257, 2551, 810, 345, 1053, 1392, 284, 711, 351, 3730, 553, 531, 7055, 18961, 7491, 2013, 10026, 11, 508, 373, 23485, 329, 2912, 13, 366, 1026, 655, 523, 4325, 284, 467, 351, 262, 5202, 286, 262, 983, 290, 655, 1645, 355, 356, 547, 2712, 523, 356, 1422, 470, 423, 284, 711, 257, 2187, 1256, 286, 3730, 526, 198, 198, 3886, 262, 886, 11, 612, 373, 257, 1074, 326, 750, 407]}

Erick Pardo is just one of many people who, for whatever reason, have taken photos of passers-by with a few sweet words in their mouths or as they eat something. His caption was posted on Facebook by a restaurant supervisor, and it's gone viral, drawing thousands of views. It turns out that even the wait staff at the restaurant are sharing the simple act - without getting in any trouble.  \"I had some time for a few moments in the morning, and thought to myself, why not?\" Pardo wrote. \"I grabbed a photo of the people as they passed me and the people had no idea I was taking the picture. I don't plan to post it elsewhere, and I'm not sure why.\" \u00a0 As for Pardo's intentions, he says he just wanted to get a few smiles on his face and send out a nice message.\nPosted by: Ace at 08:04 PM\n\n\nMuNuvians MeeNuvians Polls!

Students will develop the theoretical foundations of their disciplines by working in a team or with faculty members. The program consists of a six-year program of courses designed to equip students to think, teach, and write about women and gender as a class, as individual, or as societal category. Students are trained through the application of multiple approaches to critical analysis of the social, historical, economic, legal, and political contexts of the studies of women and gender, as identified within the social sciences. Programs in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences offer both professional and graduate degrees. The Professional Doctoral degree is the highest degree that a doctorate in gender studies can attain.

I don't think that splitting on a newline works as well, but it's a good idea to start somewhere.)\n\nWe need to know the position in the string where we should start splitting if one starts with a newline character.\n\nThis means that the order in which the values in a pair of strings are used needs to be specified.\n\nHow do we do this?\n\nIn our example, I will use the following Haskell code for testing splitAt :\n\n(splitAt 1 (se", "tokens": [3792, 612, 257, 3210, 835, 284, 6626, 257, 4731, 287, 25271, 30, 220, 3951, 290, 2456, 670, 1049, 422, 4328, 1780, 319, 257, 2272, 393, 649, 1370, 11, 475, 644, 857, 262, 366, 35312, 379, 1, 886, 286, 257, 4731, 1612, 30, 357, 9690, 11, 5658, 8, 198, 198, 438, 27758, 257, 4731, 1627, 62, 35312, 357, 325, 79, 11, 4731, 8, 796, 6626, 2953, 352, 357, 325, 79, 1343, 352, 8, 4731, 198, 198, 7, 6425, 25, 314, 1053, 3750, 736, 290, 6071, 351, 262, 3280, 994, 26, 314, 4702, 262, 366, 35312, 379, 1, 886, 286, 262, 4731, 13, 314, 1053, 635, 3421, 616, 2000, 546, 543, 886, 284, 779, 357, 35312, 2953, 657, 8, 290, 357, 35312, 2953, 604, 737, 314, 836, 470, 892, 326, 26021, 319, 257, 649, 1370, 2499, 355, 880, 11, 475, 340, 338, 257, 922, 2126, 284, 923, 7382, 2014, 198, 198, 1135, 761, 284, 760, 262, 2292, 287, 262, 4731, 810, 356, 815, 923, 26021, 611, 530, 4940, 351, 257, 649, 1370, 2095, 13, 198, 198, 1212, 1724, 326, 262, 1502, 287, 543, 262, 3815, 287, 257, 5166, 286, 13042, 389, 973, 2476, 284, 307, 7368, 13, 198, 198, 2437, 466, 356, 466, 428, 30, 198, 198, 818, 674, 1672, 11, 314, 481, 779, 262, 1708, 25271, 2438, 329, 4856, 6626, 2953, 1058, 198, 198, 7, 35312, 2953, 352, 357, 325]}

There was a reason UIDAI was created, and it was not to provide services for the people but to control everything in the country with biometric data.

One throw from Matt Elam led to an easy touchdown by Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III.\n\nIt was one of the better rookie picks from the last year's draft, and the Ravens are ready for another one next season.\n\n\"I always said when Matt gets that chance next year to practice it, get comfortable, learn the offense, learn how to play the game at the next level, how to run it and play press coverage, that's what we can expect of him and what we hope he will accomplish here,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said at the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nAccording to", "tokens": [35114, 588, 345, 821, 1016, 832, 257, 1643, 286, 5134, 15220, 30, 1320, 338, 645, 5975, 1377, 262, 4538, 318, 625, 290, 3931, 3047, 1413, 481, 307, 691, 1528, 1497, 13, 198, 198, 1537, 340, 338, 635, 645, 5975, 326, 262, 20091, 765, 262, 12302, 5228, 284, 670, 319, 465, 2832, 13, 198, 198, 1212, 1285, 1377, 262, 20091, 290, 22038, 2826, 287, 6119, 642, 286, 938, 614, 338, 5134, 13650, 13, 5856, 262, 983, 11, 20091, 3747, 4705, 412, 2543, 373, 287, 262, 826, 5228, 286, 262, 886, 6516, 11, 2491, 257, 6339, 287, 262, 3504, 286, 262, 2214, 13, 1881, 3714, 422, 4705, 412, 2543, 2957, 284, 281, 2562, 10242, 416, 22038, 7880, 5199, 16525, 6711, 13, 198, 198, 1026, 373, 530, 286, 262, 1365, 12302, 11103, 422, 262, 938, 614, 338, 4538, 11, 290, 262, 20091, 389, 3492, 329, 1194, 530, 1306, 1622, 13, 198, 198, 1, 40, 1464, 531, 618, 4705, 3011, 326, 2863, 1306, 614, 284, 3357, 340, 11, 651, 6792, 11, 2193, 262, 6907, 11, 2193, 703, 284, 711, 262, 983, 379, 262, 1306, 1241, 11, 703, 284, 1057, 340, 290, 711, 1803, 5197, 11, 326, 338, 644, 356, 460, 1607, 286, 683, 290, 644, 356, 2911, 339, 481, 9989, 994, 553, 20091, 3985, 1757, 39944, 531, 379, 262, 5134, 49716, 29176, 13, 198, 198, 4821, 284]}

{"iteration": 693, "generation": "Readers' comments on the article, 'Why I hate the term \"Muslim\"', has been very good. People said that it had become so politicized, with all the hatred for Islamic fundamentalism and the people who subscribe to it, that it is no longer useful. Some have even suggested that it should be rewritten. Here's what the writer, Peter Beaumont, and his colleague, David Battersea, have to say about that:\n\nWe thought it appropriate at the start to address the issue of Muslim terms for the sake of accuracy and clarity in terms of the media and in order to set the record straight, which is that these words have, for many people, become an epithet, and we are not immune from this.

The F.B.I. and N.S.A. spend a disproportionate amount on the federal budget, for example. Some agencies, like the Pentagon, are included in other categories.\n\nThe government deficit: The total amount a government spends minus revenues from federal taxes that are not included in the deficit is called the gross federal debt. The government's gross debt includes debt held by agencies in other categories, such as the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe deficit also represents a government's liabilities, such as interest payments it owes to its creditors, such as bondholders, and the amount of money the government currently owes its people. The deficit includes what the government spends minus what it collects from its taxes. So to be balanced by 2013, the government would have to reduce the gross debt.

Mr Assange faces allegations of sexual assault of a woman in Sweden, in which he says he carried out a sexual encounter with her in Stockholm in 2010. Mr Assange denies the allegations. Speaking at the Dagens Nyheter newspaper in a television interview, Swedish prosecutor Ingrid Isgren said a police investigation into the case is continuing and the alleged rape was also a possible motivation in a move to ask her to assist the latest investigation. The decision to interview Mr Assange is likely to inflame the row between the WikiLeaks founder and US President Barack Obama, who has demanded that the website's founder relinquish his internet privileges.

{"iteration": 755, "generation": "BIOS Password Backdoors in Laptops Synopsis: The mechanics of BIOS password locks present in current generation laptops are briefly outlined. Trivial mechanisms have been employed, with a strong password (usually on the system disk) acting as the master key. The laptop password keys can change, allowing the owner to change what password is used. If the password is compromised, the laptop becomes essentially the bootloader of choice. The user must then enter a unique login key with every boot. This key is then inserted at the start of each bootup, typically through a password prompt. We will describe how this works.

After all, zero times any number has the same meaning that it would have if we didn't have the \"zero\" in it, which makes zero times any number equal zero, doesn't it? For any number, there must either be a zero, or it can't be anything. For instance, you would think that there could only be two numbers whose sum would equal the sum of a pair of equal-by-value integers; if there were no such pairs, the value of the two integers would be the sum of their sums multiplied by 1. But this can't be. The \"zero\" in \"zero times infinity\" is a meaningless, meaningless number. We can't say that two are equal-by-value ints by dividing the values of the integers, even if that doesn't matter.

It's been praised by politicians and journalists for its efficiency and innovation, especially since the company took the bold step of offering direct Uber and Lyft rides and a carpooling service.\n\nUber hopes to be the de facto taxi service in Toronto to rival the likes of UberX and Lyft \u2013 which also offer discounted rides to people who hail a taxi.

This is the core behavior of this basic recursive function.\n\nIn case you don't get it, we used (and still use) the \"==\" operator to determine which of the numbers in the array was the positive and which of them was the negative.\n\nIf you want an example, here it is:\n\n>>> for n in 1..10: ... print", "tokens": [1639, 389, 2045, 379, 257, 845, 2829, 2163, 543, 2753, 734, 10007, 2124, 290, 331, 290, 5860, 257, 41146, 611, 262, 331, 12, 22704, 393, 2124, 12, 22704, 318, 3967, 393, 4633, 13, 2102, 11, 262, 2163, 318, 1682, 2407, 3716, 290, 262, 3280, 318, 1107, 11, 1107, 8253, 13, 3914, 338, 1011, 257, 5699, 804, 379, 644, 340, 857, 13, 198, 198, 1212, 318, 422, 262, 11361, 4941, 10107, 290, 318, 11, 6209, 11, 281, 366, 10745, 9504, 9052, 526, 632, 8075, 257, 45115, 9052, 625, 25175, 357, 31591, 8, 3146, 13, 1629, 1123, 10139, 287, 262, 9052, 11, 340, 8404, 284, 1064, 503, 257, 366, 7942, 1, 331, 12, 22704, 1988, 290, 318, 2035, 4504, 357, 24561, 8, 393, 9514, 357, 31591, 737, 770, 318, 262, 4755, 4069, 286, 428, 4096, 45115, 2163, 13, 198, 198, 818, 1339, 345, 836, 470, 651, 340, 11, 356, 973, 357, 392, 991, 779, 8, 262, 366, 855, 1, 10088, 284, 5004, 543, 286, 262, 3146, 287, 262, 7177, 373, 262, 3967, 290, 543, 286, 606, 373, 262, 4633, 13, 198, 198, 1532, 345, 765, 281, 1672, 11, 994, 340, 318, 25, 198, 198, 33409, 329, 299, 287, 352, 492, 940, 25, 2644, 3601]}

On Tuesday, the teenager, who was not identified, made the claim at a press conference at a police substation. The boy who has been charged with one count each of felonious assault and second-degree murder was the son of a longtime CPD officer. Officials also said they are seeking to speak with a second minor charged as an accomplice. The teen reportedly told officers at a news conference Tuesday night that his mother was killed sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning, in a case that has outraged the community.

We used lipid peroxidation reaction monitoring and electron cryomicroscopy to analyze the lipid peroxidation status of human serum and skin collagen and the extent of lipid oxidation.\n\nRESULTS:  St. John's wort showed significant inhibitory effects on non-oxidative lipid peroxidation in serum, collagen, and skin.

{"iteration": 1000, "generation": "Q: Is there any method (other than getting out of the boat or running off shore) for getting people to stop doing what they are doing to the ship?\n\n\na) They will always stop. The first time they hear there is something wrong, the first thing they will do is to get on a rope to stop a rope, put it over their head for safety and make the others go get a rope and do the same thing, then they can tell them to stop. They are trained, in fact they were trained a long time ago. So if your group is not on a rope when they hear a sound, ask them what they are doing, and then run off a rope, or grab someone from the boat or on the boat, and convince them to run over to the rope. If you can do this, they will stop just like the others.\n\n\nb) After they have stopped and you are standing there waiting in a place where they are not going to get off a rope, run back over the rope", "tokens": [48, 25, 1148, 612, 597, 2446, 357, 847, 621, 1972, 503, 286, 262, 8848, 393, 2491, 572, 15191, 8, 329, 1972, 661, 284, 2245, 1804, 644, 484, 389, 1804, 284, 262, 4074, 30, 628, 198, 64, 8, 1119, 481, 1464, 2245, 13, 383, 717, 640, 484, 3285, 612, 318, 1223, 2642, 11, 262, 717, 1517, 484, 481, 466, 318, 284, 651, 319, 257, 17182, 284, 2245, 257, 17182, 11, 1234, 340, 625, 511, 1182, 329, 3747, 290, 787, 262, 1854, 467, 651, 257, 17182, 290, 466, 262, 976, 1517, 11, 788, 484, 460, 1560, 606, 284, 2245, 13, 1119, 389, 8776, 11, 287, 1109, 484, 547, 8776, 257, 890, 640, 2084, 13, 1406, 611, 534, 1448, 318, 407, 319, 257, 17182, 618, 484, 3285, 257, 2128, 11, 1265, 606, 644, 484, 389, 1804, 11, 290, 788, 1057, 572, 257, 17182, 11, 393, 5552, 2130, 422, 262, 8848, 393, 319, 262, 8848, 11, 290, 11508, 606, 284, 1057, 625, 284, 262, 17182, 13, 1002, 345, 460, 466, 428, 11, 484, 481, 2245, 655, 588, 262, 1854, 13, 628, 198, 65, 8, 2293, 484, 423, 5025, 290, 345, 389, 5055, 612, 4953, 287, 257, 1295, 810, 484, 389, 407, 1016, 284, 651, 572, 257, 17182, 11, 1057, 736, 625, 262, 17182]}
