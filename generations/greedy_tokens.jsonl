Yet, evolution of lactase persistence has divided the human species into those that can or cannot digest lactose and those that cannot. This study investigates the role of lactase persistence in the evolution of lactose tolerance in humans. The study is based on a large sample of lactose-tolerant and lactose-intolerant individuals from the United States. The results show that lactase persistence is a major determinant of lactose tolerance in humans. The study also shows that lactase persistence is a major determinant of lactose tolerance in non-human primates.", "tokens": [23839, 1058, 46579, 9013, 3994, 3716, 20901, 543, 9427, 351, 262, 2583, 13, 6430, 11, 6954, 286, 26222, 589, 30802, 468, 9086, 262, 1692, 4693, 656, 883, 326, 460, 393, 2314, 16274, 26222, 577, 290, 883, 326, 2314, 13, 770, 2050, 44846, 262, 2597, 286, 26222, 589, 30802, 287, 262, 6954, 286, 26222, 577, 15621, 287, 5384, 13, 383, 2050, 318, 1912, 319, 257, 1588, 6291, 286, 26222, 577, 12, 83, 13625, 415, 290, 26222, 577, 12, 600, 13625, 415, 3925, 422, 262, 1578, 1829, 13, 383, 2482, 905, 326, 26222, 589, 30802, 318, 257, 1688, 3416, 415, 286, 26222, 577, 15621, 287, 5384, 13, 383, 2050, 635, 2523, 326, 26222, 589, 30802, 318, 257, 1688, 3416, 415, 286, 26222, 577, 15621, 287, 1729, 12, 10734, 41316, 13]}
