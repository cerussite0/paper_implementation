Behind each suggestion is a system of black-box calculations and resampling equations that we use to pick the most likely candidate based on a conservative estimate of the percentage likelihood the ad will be most likely to increase, or decrease, a specific ad unit's click-through rate.\n\nYou are an outlier among me (the rest of you are not).\n\nThis is essentially identical to assessing the event share OF", "tokens": [6601, 318, 262, 8489, 286, 1414, 12, 525, 12, 12976, 7124, 26, 340, 338, 1111, 262, 416, 12, 11167, 286, 790, 2223, 21846, 11, 290, 262, 2723, 286, 2853, 10720, 543, 2223, 318, 262, 749, 4388, 13, 632, 788, 4329, 1593, 284, 1833, 508, 318, 6301, 644, 355, 881, 355, 1744, 11, 1111, 284, 787, 257, 16106, 290, 10039, 17952, 286, 262, 5909, 3741, 286, 1910, 2648, 7247, 416, 16958, 3011, 262, 749, 3904, 12, 9579, 82, 319, 257, 2443, 11, 290, 284, 5409, 703, 881, 284, 1325, 287, 2695, 284, 8515, 883, 3904, 12, 9579, 82, 784, 23546, 9011, 852, 262, 1266, 1517, 40758, 13, 554, 428, 835, 11, 356, 460, 4136, 883, 508, 389, 262, 1266, 21779, 286, 6482, 13, 198, 198, 2514, 8636, 674, 5387, 39629, 3127, 11, 356, 466, 257, 2168, 286, 8925, 3537, 41576, 5254, 319, 674, 1366, 286, 262, 749, 4156, 512, 6443, 13, 20787, 1123, 13052, 318, 257, 1080, 286, 2042, 12, 3524, 16765, 290, 581, 321, 11347, 27490, 326, 356, 779, 284, 2298, 262, 749, 1884, 4540, 1912, 319, 257, 5940, 8636, 286, 262, 5873, 14955, 262, 512, 481, 307, 749, 1884, 284, 2620, 11, 393, 10070, 11, 257, 2176, 512, 4326, 338, 3904, 12, 9579, 2494, 13, 198, 198, 1639, 389, 281, 503, 2505, 1871, 502, 357, 1169, 1334, 286, 345, 389, 407, 737, 198, 198, 1212, 318, 6986, 10411, 284, 24171, 262, 1785, 2648, 3963]}

If the substrate patches are not fully removed, the algae will remain hard and can cause serious health problems. Most people who test are careless.

The operation aimed to unite forces, clear the Houthi rebels from Sana'a, and set up an effective government to govern all Yemen, petrochemical workers said. However, the Houthis and Saleh fled to high ground in the mountains and troops, two of whom were reportedly killed in April, began some small offensive operations inside the country. The government and pro-Hadi factions had brushed aside the offensive, which began in January. For its part, the United States and international forces said the attack waged by the Houthis and Saleh came just one day after Washington declared that the Houthis had abandoned their hold.

On forums everywhere, hotheads of every stripe have thrown gallons of gas in the joint. While this long-awaited flamewar is most likely to join the Napolean reboot as the thinly veiled name of the new franchise, the fanboys grew tired of the titanic posturing behind escalating their rants. In all seriousness, War of the Fanboys was high-key on television, and thus awkward to watch with bigger stars. But don't worry, the same nit-picky shtick that made War Of the Fanboys a huge hit called for its follow-up, see below. Guest Stars in War of the Fanboys: None the less, fanboys know a nice pile of nuttery when they see it.

At issue in the brain in gender equality research has been the notion that gender identity does not determine a person's starting point in life -- which is not an issue in the paper.

{"iteration": 185, "generation": "We live in an age in which mobile technology has forever altered ways of interacting and doing business. In most ways, it has helped open up a new and truly wide range of activities and experiences. But there are those who think that if you want us to all identify the technologies that have been central to the digitization revolution, reducing the centrality of digitization and how our lives are increasingly changed through technology, moving us beyond the success or failure of these new technologies directly as part of our everyday experiences, then we need to start talking about specializations, since the eyeballs of the observer won't see everything. But a one-size-fits-all foundational approach to understanding today's digital economy does little more than perpetuate and accelerate the fragmentation of today's political economy. This is why many today say they do not share the priorities espoused by those who advocate for a return to traditional economic authorities. Others reject the idea of reinterpreting or rethinking economic research for the 21st century. And some have found sympathetic ears in low-information sector community here in Washington, D.C.\n\nMichael Shrier, DreamWorks Animation: Ex", "tokens": [1135, 2107, 287, 281, 2479, 287, 543, 5175, 3037, 468, 8097, 14294, 2842, 286, 24986, 290, 1804, 1597, 13, 554, 749, 2842, 11, 340, 468, 4193, 1280, 510, 257, 649, 290, 4988, 3094, 2837, 286, 4568, 290, 6461, 13, 887, 612, 389, 883, 508, 892, 326, 611, 345, 765, 514, 284, 477, 5911, 262, 8514, 326, 423, 587, 4318, 284, 262, 16839, 1634, 5854, 11, 8868, 262, 4318, 414, 286, 16839, 1634, 290, 703, 674, 3160, 389, 6481, 3421, 832, 3037, 11, 3867, 514, 3675, 262, 1943, 393, 5287, 286, 777, 649, 8514, 3264, 355, 636, 286, 674, 10908, 6461, 11, 788, 356, 761, 284, 923, 3375, 546, 2041, 4582, 11, 1201, 262, 16067, 5691, 286, 262, 22890, 1839, 470, 766, 2279, 13, 887, 257, 530, 12, 7857, 12, 21013, 12, 439, 43936, 3164, 284, 4547, 1909, 338, 4875, 3773, 857, 1310, 517, 621, 43874, 290, 22636, 262, 42965, 286, 1909, 338, 1964, 3773, 13, 770, 318, 1521, 867, 1909, 910, 484, 466, 407, 2648, 262, 15369, 15024, 29997, 416, 883, 508, 12811, 329, 257, 1441, 284, 4569, 3034, 4773, 13, 12691, 4968, 262, 2126, 286, 302, 3849, 3866, 889, 393, 302, 28973, 3034, 2267, 329, 262, 2310, 301, 4289, 13, 843, 617, 423, 1043, 22335, 11368, 287, 1877, 12, 17018, 6567, 2055, 994, 287, 2669, 11, 360, 13, 34, 13, 198, 198, 13256, 911, 5277, 11, 7610, 23044, 23535, 25, 1475]}

{"iteration": 217, "generation": "Abstract : Dairy foods contain complex nutrients which interact with the host. Yet, evolution of lactase persistence has divided the human species into those that can or cannot consume lactase-eps and those which do not (1,2). We describe the development of the lactase persistence allele in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and here prove that it can be successfully transmitted by natural selection to humans. Regular eating of yogurt, jellies, milk products, and exotic dairy products confirms this use of lactase as a natural selection tool. Attached data sets of the English Ice Age genome sequence provide allometric analysis in phylogenetic trees and demonstrate that the trait is exceptionally adaptive in Africans after neutral change (i.e., surfaced by natural selection). Interplay between lactase in aurochs and human lactase persistence genes explains their high frequency. This historical evidence establishes that the innateness of the ability to consume lactase could have arisen very early in our species' evolutionary history.\n\nAuthor Contributions Conceived and designed the experiments: EG DA TM.

Lynn, a self-proclaimed podcaster from Virginia, apparently took a liking to some of Trump's \u2014 and her \u2014 infamously clannish rhetoric. Despite elaborating on the idea, Trump later on tweeted that he liked the severed head and made a joke about trying to use it inside a Van Duzer grill. Regardless, Lynn's head-confort expressed just how unnecessary this unique interaction remains in our lives. And even more shockingly, this tradition of finger-pointing and finger-gripping continues. Clinton's press secretary Brian Fallon responded to Trump's criticisms of Comey, who concluded the extra investigation only to allow Clinton to email her private servers throughout her time as secretary of state, in a tweet that made such sentiments seem trite.\n\n", "tokens": [7371, 1301, 1141, 262, 717, 4787, 4384, 357, 34204, 8, 220, 1081, 262, 9751, 290, 24054, 3756, 510, 284, 262, 717, 4787, 4384, 1022, 3759, 1301, 290, 5073, 2605, 17676, 1973, 2253, 11, 530, 1048, 22798, 284, 530, 286, 262, 3071, 18406, 338, 749, 13835, 10181, 286, 1561, 5243, 416, 12560, 465, 21140, 1288, 270, 396, 477, 23823, 422, 262, 7563, 12, 34, 871, 319, 3759, 1301, 338, 1182, 13, 24868, 11, 257, 2116, 12, 39865, 24573, 17970, 422, 6025, 11, 5729, 1718, 257, 24976, 284, 617, 286, 1301, 338, 851, 290, 607, 851, 1167, 321, 3481, 537, 1236, 680, 13214, 13, 7945, 12628, 803, 319, 262, 2126, 11, 1301, 1568, 319, 10830, 326, 339, 8288, 262, 32160, 1182, 290, 925, 257, 9707, 546, 2111, 284, 779, 340, 2641, 257, 6656, 10343, 9107, 29901, 13, 22250, 11, 24868, 338, 1182, 12, 1102, 3319, 6241, 655, 703, 13114, 428, 3748, 10375, 3793, 287, 674, 3160, 13, 843, 772, 517, 49992, 11, 428, 6761, 286, 7660, 12, 4122, 278, 290, 7660, 12, 70, 380, 2105, 4477, 13, 2605, 338, 1803, 7705, 8403, 36503, 7082, 284, 1301, 338, 25094, 286, 12388, 11, 508, 8391, 262, 3131, 3645, 691, 284, 1249, 2605, 284, 3053, 607, 2839, 9597, 3690, 607, 640, 355, 7705, 286, 1181, 11, 287, 257, 6126, 326, 925, 884, 26930, 1283, 491, 578, 13, 628]}

{"iteration": 283, "generation": "PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - The owners of a Portland-area bakery who refused on religious grounds to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple have paid about $144,000 to settle a lawsuit from the woman's next of kin, the Multnomah County Circuit Court ruled on Friday.\n\nThe owners of Mama Cakes by Melissa, whose store for years had baked wedding cakes for lesbian couples in Portland, told the legal team of Nicole Tomes that they will run the company as they see fit.\n\nFour Ellen DeGeneres sisters - Marie DeGeneres, Angie Hollman, Tatiana Cantwell and Kris Kremers - sued the bakery in 2016 alleging it violated Oregon law by refusing to make the cakes. DeGeneres ultimately left the team after a dating dispute with executive producer Gavin Grimm, who helped create the episode.\n\nNone of the sisters attended the hearing on Friday, but statements from Alisha Dawson, attorney for DeGeneres, and Holly Poindexter, attorney for the Estes sisters, marked the roots of the settlement. DeGeneres' attorneys are saying they commend the Portland bakery company for pursuing a compromise", "tokens": [15490, 28182, 11, 22452, 13, 357, 12637, 8, 532, 383, 4393, 286, 257, 10727, 12, 20337, 38164, 508, 6520, 319, 4158, 9384, 284, 28450, 257, 10614, 12187, 329, 257, 17834, 3155, 423, 3432, 546, 720, 18444, 11, 830, 284, 12259, 257, 8087, 422, 262, 2415, 338, 1306, 286, 18967, 11, 262, 7854, 26601, 993, 3418, 13588, 3078, 8879, 319, 3217, 13, 198, 198, 464, 4393, 286, 40084, 327, 1124, 416, 24164, 11, 3025, 3650, 329, 812, 550, 22979, 10614, 30849, 329, 17834, 11886, 287, 10727, 11, 1297, 262, 2742, 1074, 286, 25176, 309, 2586, 326, 484, 481, 1057, 262, 1664, 355, 484, 766, 4197, 13, 198, 198, 15137, 23811, 1024, 39358, 411, 15153, 532, 20492, 1024, 39358, 411, 11, 2895, 494, 11806, 805, 11, 29070, 7484, 16821, 4053, 290, 27748, 509, 2787, 364, 532, 16334, 262, 38164, 287, 1584, 26116, 340, 13998, 8819, 1099, 416, 15487, 284, 787, 262, 30849, 13, 1024, 39358, 411, 6165, 1364, 262, 1074, 706, 257, 10691, 11047, 351, 4640, 9920, 30857, 27145, 11, 508, 4193, 2251, 262, 4471, 13, 198, 198, 14202, 286, 262, 15153, 9141, 262, 4854, 319, 3217, 11, 475, 6299, 422, 978, 19388, 32801, 11, 6136, 329, 1024, 39358, 411, 11, 290, 7764, 7695, 9630, 353, 11, 6136, 329, 262, 10062, 274, 15153, 11, 7498, 262, 11135, 286, 262, 9443, 13, 1024, 39358, 411, 6, 14449, 389, 2282, 484, 35695, 262, 10727, 38164, 1664, 329, 15461, 257, 13110]}

So there I was at the Toronto International Film Festival dealing with what in my hearts I would description as \"wit-bit-changing\" footage, an exposure I've come to know and love.  I was one of six people invited to the \"30 Years of Refugees\" premiere screening in memory of New Casanova , a recently curated film by David Diamond about British refugee administrative systems from the 1950s to the present day.  I lost count of the number of times I saw it with a sympathetic smile and a small, sleeping child in the background.

In this case, however, it's important to take a broader view of democracy and what it means. All across the world, governments are being bailed out. They are first and foremost a version of government in which one party dominates. Debt is a constant threat, because if one government stops paying the installments, then another takes over. Power is vestigeally political, because parties and politicians are still relevant. The government that's suffering is the first to capitulate, because of lack of outside patronage or security forces that would slow it or possibly defend its actions.

{"iteration": 429, "generation": "Amiibo Shortage  Wired wrote an interesting article a while back about an amiibo bubble. The article cites a few reasons for the delay in getting a first batch of Amiibo. The main one, perhaps in the dragging out period, is that it is harder for the game to design and develop each piece of the game. For example, setting a Stage: Balloon is almost identical to the stage Balloon Brawl. There is not enough room to fit multiple differently themed stages in a game. The pieces need to be set up in a way that would support multiple stages at the same time. For that, lots of time is needed to get the puzzle just right. This amount of time makes it difficult to get a set of Amiibo to consumers. Granted, you could move quickly to get more than one order in a month, but with a game this large, many orders could be out of sync with shipping. So while it may take longer to get a cost break on an Amiibo, the extra work is worth it to get early access to the game when people are crunching on their jobs.\n\n", "tokens": [5840, 72, 26762, 10073, 496, 220, 39721, 2630, 281, 3499, 2708, 257, 981, 736, 546, 281, 716, 72, 26762, 14310, 13, 383, 2708, 23474, 257, 1178, 3840, 329, 262, 5711, 287, 1972, 257, 717, 15458, 286, 1703, 72, 26762, 13, 383, 1388, 530, 11, 3737, 287, 262, 25046, 503, 2278, 11, 318, 326, 340, 318, 7069, 329, 262, 983, 284, 1486, 290, 1205, 1123, 3704, 286, 262, 983, 13, 1114, 1672, 11, 4634, 257, 15371, 25, 47821, 318, 2048, 10411, 284, 262, 3800, 47821, 31871, 13, 1318, 318, 407, 1576, 2119, 284, 4197, 3294, 10338, 31892, 9539, 287, 257, 983, 13, 383, 5207, 761, 284, 307, 900, 510, 287, 257, 835, 326, 561, 1104, 3294, 9539, 379, 262, 976, 640, 13, 1114, 326, 11, 6041, 286, 640, 318, 2622, 284, 651, 262, 15027, 655, 826, 13, 770, 2033, 286, 640, 1838, 340, 2408, 284, 651, 257, 900, 286, 1703, 72, 26762, 284, 7008, 13, 38842, 11, 345, 714, 1445, 2952, 284, 651, 517, 621, 530, 1502, 287, 257, 1227, 11, 475, 351, 257, 983, 428, 1588, 11, 867, 6266, 714, 307, 503, 286, 17510, 351, 8440, 13, 1406, 981, 340, 743, 1011, 2392, 284, 651, 257, 1575, 2270, 319, 281, 1703, 72, 26762, 11, 262, 3131, 670, 318, 2861, 340, 284, 651, 1903, 1895, 284, 262, 983, 618, 661, 389, 23527, 278, 319, 511, 3946, 13, 628]}

Credit: Mark Hoffman  By of the  Defensive end Johnny Jolly was not so lucky on the opening day of camp. Incredible as it may seem, Jolly suffered a concussion in practice during a June 19 drill. At one point, he snapped the puck off his head and was taken to the sideline by trainers. Joe LaMichaela took the reins as the defensive end, but immediately cracked in the second scrimmage. So, along with Corey Linsley, Justin McCray and Mike Person, Jolly was replaced by O'Keefe and Hauptman in the beginning of the second period. When the third unit came on the ice, they did not play well, so Ricky Oleksiak got in again.

Exploration for oysters is expanded best along other backwater Bay cities, such as Basking, North Wales.\n\n20/20\n\nTo listen to 20/20 premium podcast that interviews awesome people, subscribe to 24/7 Insight audio updates.\n\n20/20 Part 1 Week 4 \u2013 18 October", "tokens": [22603, 507, 286, 6868, 35104, 5937, 389, 284, 307, 1234, 656, 262, 4294, 298, 11, 1752, 262, 2524, 286, 2031, 338, 4387, 35104, 1706, 17685, 88, 13, 220, 383, 1936, 12, 1941, 1628, 12031, 717, 284, 900, 510, 4632, 2055, 31332, 9691, 1826, 11, 257, 10413, 11971, 416, 262, 1748, 6745, 284, 1262, 262, 4294, 298, 35104, 5937, 355, 262, 8472, 4308, 329, 257, 1748, 4421, 35104, 1706, 3595, 1989, 13, 770, 3164, 318, 3177, 517, 19992, 290, 6942, 621, 1111, 9361, 262, 6156, 2446, 286, 47478, 2667, 329, 3869, 11, 543, 318, 29862, 3105, 290, 5789, 284, 466, 11, 290, 9648, 284, 651, 262, 6034, 669, 290, 511, 6147, 5112, 656, 262, 3534, 896, 286, 2580, 992, 710, 13, 36806, 329, 35104, 5937, 318, 9902, 1266, 1863, 584, 736, 7050, 4696, 4736, 11, 884, 355, 347, 30463, 11, 2258, 11769, 13, 198, 198, 1238, 14, 1238, 198, 198, 2514, 6004, 284, 1160, 14, 1238, 8683, 9905, 326, 9299, 7427, 661, 11, 12383, 284, 1987, 14, 22, 39917, 6597, 5992, 13, 198, 198, 1238, 14, 1238, 2142, 352, 6119, 604, 784, 1248, 3267]}
{"iteration": 616, "generation": "Tesla President reveals key insight into company forecasts; Gigafactory will cut battery costs in half [Video]  Earlier this Spring, at the International Fleet Meeting in Costa Mesa, California, Tesla Motors unveiled its most ambitious and specific forecast yet for electric vehicle expansion. The electric car company is on the verge of delivering 80,000 vehicles per year from the Gigafactory in Nevada, which is expected to spur 1,000 new construction projects. Existing battery capacity is also forecast to increase, allowing for greater models from Tesla to be produced in production. But Elon Musk revealed the bullpen of resources that his company has allocated at this time; many targets are nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe publication of these low prices is unprecedented in automobile history. \"The last time we saw such a low price for batteries was when the 2004 4.6-liter V6 diesel engine was a $183,000 package. Last night, price of Pentax image lenses was $180, which, while a large loss, is way better than the new low price for earlier generation DSLR batteries.\"\n\nTake a gander for yourself:", "tokens": [41351, 1992, 10069, 1994, 11281, 656, 1664, 26119, 26, 19525, 1878, 9548, 481, 2005, 6555, 3484, 287, 2063, 685, 10798, 60, 220, 20635, 428, 8225, 11, 379, 262, 4037, 20001, 22244, 287, 18133, 26670, 11, 3442, 11, 11938, 19292, 18475, 663, 749, 14742, 290, 2176, 11092, 1865, 329, 5186, 4038, 7118, 13, 383, 5186, 1097, 1664, 318, 319, 262, 27373, 286, 13630, 4019, 11, 830, 5672, 583, 614, 422, 262, 19525, 1878, 9548, 287, 12087, 11, 543, 318, 2938, 284, 26724, 352, 11, 830, 649, 5103, 4493, 13, 1475, 9665, 6555, 5339, 318, 635, 11092, 284, 2620, 11, 5086, 329, 3744, 4981, 422, 11938, 284, 307, 4635, 287, 3227, 13, 887, 32451, 20119, 4602, 262, 35093, 286, 4133, 326, 465, 1664, 468, 19171, 379, 428, 640, 26, 867, 6670, 389, 12062, 284, 307, 1775, 13, 198, 198, 464, 9207, 286, 777, 1877, 4536, 318, 13029, 287, 27930, 2106, 13, 366, 464, 938, 640, 356, 2497, 884, 257, 1877, 2756, 329, 13591, 373, 618, 262, 5472, 604, 13, 21, 12, 17201, 569, 21, 21866, 3113, 373, 257, 720, 24839, 11, 830, 5301, 13, 4586, 1755, 11, 2756, 286, 9696, 897, 2939, 18405, 373, 720, 15259, 11, 543, 11, 981, 257, 1588, 2994, 11, 318, 835, 1365, 621, 262, 649, 1877, 2756, 329, 2961, 5270, 32643, 49, 13591, 526, 198, 198, 12322, 257, 308, 4066, 329, 3511, 25]}

Passing on him in the draft and signing on in the Entry Draft, Rutherford then waited for Letang to develop and emerge. Letang hit the ground running and finally broke out in 2013-14. He's improved his game to the point that he had a breakout season at even strength, showing the lanky Swede that he's mature and has what it takes to be a top four defenseman. Further, another measuring stick for whether or not his development is steady was the first half of the season. His pace increased steadily until training camp.

While static localization is already excellently done, it would not suffice if some translations were made by user input.\n\nSince the majority of people are not accustomed to a WordPress \"shell\", the ability to add the translation back to the WordPress-shell means there is way more feasible ways for user input. The plugin offers a way for the user to translate the name of the stage, song or song title into Middle-Eastern languages. In real world, a user simply goes to the website and uploads and edits a screenshot. This type of multilingual text is available and as such widely used by most sites. But this simplicity can be a barrier to new users trying to learn the plugin.\n\nThe plugin provides a feature called 'Multilingual Text Improvements'.

It flows from the south side of Albertville to south of the Harris County Forest Service campus. This spring, the river can reach up to 14 feet in height. The water stays high for about 20 years and then drains northward. The water level filled up in the springs near Settler Town and Valero interchange. In the early 1970s, the Texas Legislature lifted the ban on exotic alien species in the state. Many species are now available for consumption, including Compsognathus aseptor hosberry, Schauenseme Berliner and Alaua elra . The artificial springs have been included in plans to remove the impacts to the Earth Network.

On the 24th's episode of MBC's 'iKnock,' the members teamed up to participate in a mission plan to help educate small shops about how to use balloons to sell tickets. In the stunt, the girls participated in the standard cheerleading routine where they wear number 7 and jump to cheers that rise up to the sky.  Today, the members performed a variety of background choreographies. If the choreography involved lifting objects like balloons or lighting something, their final songs would have been much cooler. If they had performed a test version of their original songs, I would have been a bit uncomfortable with the choreography. However, I'm glad they still did their test procedures with all the talent involved and were able to get it right because 67.9% of their concept came from simplicity.

Of course, I consider myself an all around weird person, although I do admit it took a lot for me to even admit it to myself. Trust me, in both the nose and the heart, there's something to be said about cherries and spiced cheeses.

On slick leaves, the pastel purple nature of that cedar puts a cool heat onto the dry coumarin notes. There's hints of threshold, but that's a bit too much of a scent to remember.

{"iteration": 940, "generation": "Lecture Notes on Cryptography  Abstract: This is a set of lecture notes for a summer course on cryptography, taught by the authors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Normally, a materials analysis class would unitize notes dealing primarily with particular topics, but this is absolutely not the case here. Cryptography is, of course, one of the two major types of schemes that we discuss in cryptography. The other type involves sending strings of bytes from one computer to another, encoding them as a stream of bytes, and then encrypting the stream using one of the notation systems that you have just studied to determine the message. A flaw in the standard approach to encryption lets the \"shell\" used in plaintext-encryption tricks become predictable, and then ideally you can just intercept those enciphered messages using brute force, which allows you to decrypt the message. Since even as a beginner you can master k-th specialsights (Ghost, P-Chops, Sleuth), a given algebra, most slowly, cryptography is a fairly infinite set, so completing this lectures class is a high priority.

According to Maclean's magazine, automakers are eying open-wheel racing for development, busy efforts to ramp up vehicle inventory, and tire production.\n", "tokens": [31305, 1014, 832, 2177, 11, 8295, 4200, 287, 4744, 11687, 1478, 1411, 625, 262, 2180, 614, 11, 968, 8221, 11687, 2310, 1411, 11, 290, 3936, 11687, 1478, 1411, 13, 679, 4367, 11, 366, 1135, 2497, 777, 5732, 329, 1262, 4569, 3884, 284, 9604, 257, 1097, 11, 290, 635, 1972, 15435, 329, 257, 1363, 13, 38303, 17368, 43765, 287, 2258, 5913, 6718, 2004, 351, 262, 4219, 286, 262, 2351, 13944, 10006, 1879, 8324, 3255, 27752, 326, 1718, 1295, 832, 3217, 878, 262, 23964, 526, 198, 198, 8332, 25601, 7734, 329, 1811, 812, 11, 2260, 9604, 13684, 6260, 3271, 47665, 531, 11, 366, 30638, 428, 4639, 1203, 2607, 1097, 481, 307, 257, 983, 1488, 263, 526, 1375, 635, 6235, 503, 326, 1998, 351, 4639, 1203, 5006, 481, 366, 16794, 606, 307, 14178, 780, 484, 481, 307, 366, 1203, 2945, 416, 1692, 4049, 588, 1997, 2073, 287, 262, 995, 526, 198, 198, 38062, 3979, 389, 13795, 306, 3910, 326, 1280, 1879, 6119, 481, 307, 257, 640, 6768, 512, 1850, 416, 262, 21135, 14568, 11069, 284, 766, 262, 2003, 13, 4784, 284, 4100, 13087, 338, 7093, 11, 47296, 389, 304, 1112, 1280, 12, 22001, 11717, 329, 2478, 11, 8179, 4040, 284, 10454, 510, 4038, 13184, 11, 290, 15867, 3227, 13, 198]}
